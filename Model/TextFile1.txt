There are three possible return types for async methods: Task, Task<T> and void, 
but the natural return types for async methods are just Task and Task<T>. 
When converting from synchronous to asynchronous code, any method returning a type T becomes an async method returning Task<T>, 
and any method returning void becomes an async method returning Task. 

Async All The Way
As you convert synchronous code to asynchronous code, you’ll find that it works best if asynchronous code,
calls and is called by other asynchronous code—all the way down (or “up,” if you prefer)
